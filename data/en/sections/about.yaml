# a summary about you
summary: |
  Iâ€™ve started this site to share the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained initially as a Power Platform Developer. In January 2024 I started as a Consultant at Wortell, and in June I also became an MCT. Being a former hairdresser, turned IT, no coding background, no degree and self-taught on most things, I feel itâ€™s important to share the knowledge, so others can also learn from it. 
  
  I was awarded with the Microsoft MVP Award for the first time in June 2023, and re-awarded in 2024. 
  Still very excited to continue to share the knowledge!

  My most recent engagement was in Prague where I did a workshop on Power Automate together with the amazing Hugo Bernier, a Women in Tech panel with Angie and Valerie, and spoke on Virtual Tables.
