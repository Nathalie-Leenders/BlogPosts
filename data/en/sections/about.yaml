# a summary about you
summary: |
  I’ve started this site to share the knowledge I’ve gained as a Power Platform Developer. In January 2024 I started as a Consultant at Wortell, and in June I also became an MCT. Being a former hairdresser, turned IT, no coding background, no degree and self-taught on most things, I feel it’s important to share the knowledge, so others can also learn from it. 
  
  I was awarded with the Microsoft MVP Award for the first time in June 2023, very excited to continue to share the knowledge!
