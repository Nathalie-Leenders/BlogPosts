&lt;p>I have a use case, where someone wants to press a button or phone icon, and that teams calls a specific person, how do I do this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few ways to call someone:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To a defined global, context, or environment variable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Specific persons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pre-defined phone number&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Use the Launch command to launch a website that in turn launches MS Teams&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick tip!
