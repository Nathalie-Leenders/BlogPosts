&lt;p>I had a usecase, where we wanted to create a version number metadata field. We could of course use an integer, count using increment, and upload to the field, however that only does &amp;lsquo;major&amp;rsquo; counts i.e 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To do this, you can follow the same logic, but use a float value instead of integer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New options for Gen AI and Bing AI Search</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/copilotstudiogenai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 09:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/copilotstudiogenai/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="usecase">Usecase&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I am creating a Model driven app, with a Virtual Table connected to SQL. In my SQL DB I have an external primary key field. How do I get an automatic GUID? The PowerFX code GUID() is not supported on the form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I tried to do something on the ribbon, set the field,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code class="language-PowerFX" data-lang="PowerFX">With({I:Last(Werknems).TransactionID},Notify( I, NotificationType.Information));
Patch(
Werknems,
Defaults(Werknems), //Row,
{TransactionID:GUID()
}
)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>However, since my field is mandatory, and it tries to save before it runs this (of course) it was saying the field wasnt filled in. So this didnt work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Virtual Tables - ALM variables announcement &amp; Power Pages</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/virtualtablesmppc23announcements/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 09:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/virtualtablesmppc23announcements/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="mppc-2023---getting-to-announce-brand-new-features">MPPC 2023 - Getting to announce brand new features!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>You need to share a file from sharepoint to an external user, in an automated process. No manual &amp;lsquo;create link&amp;rsquo; actions needed on the sharepoint site. You can then email this link to your external client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Default on Power automate for a sharing link for sharepoint, is to set the Link Scope to either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Anyone with the link (including anonymous)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>People in your organization&lt;/p>

Boolean in SQL</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/boolean-in-sql/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/boolean-in-sql/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="are-you-looking-for-a-boolean-column-in-sql-or-have-a-virtual-table-and-need-a-togglecheckbox-in-your-app">Are you looking for a boolean column in SQL? Or have a virtual table and need a toggle/checkbox in your app?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you have just a string/text field with True/False this wont work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You need to convert the column in SQL to BIT.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bit is an integer data type that can take a value of 0, 1, or NULL
1 for true, 0 for false.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then reload/refresh your table into your dataverse/virtual table and it can be selected with a checkbox!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dataverse Choices to SQL backend- Update!</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/dataversechoices-sqlbackend/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/dataversechoices-sqlbackend/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Changing the button for “Fork” into “Bork!” for Github</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/forktobork/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/forktobork/</guid><description>&lt;p>This has to be the best thing to come out of 2023 (and yes, it’s only January so that’s saying something)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was on the First Time Contributor training yesterday, one of the Sharing is Caring sessions led by David Warner and Hugo Bernier. (&amp;lt;3) M365 &amp;amp; Power Platform | Sharing Is Caring (pnp.github.io)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this training they explain how Github works, and how to edit an existing item using the Branches, Forks, Committing changes and how a Pull Request works. (I can highly recommend their sessions if you want to learn, there’s no recordings and it’s a safe space for all to ask questions and interrupt)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding a count to your Power Automate Flow (Integer/Increment variable)</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/countinvariables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/countinvariables/</guid><description>&lt;p>Starting with an intro to variables, I want to explain how you can use a very simple counter to your Power Automate flow.
Let’s say you have an Apply to each, like 5 entries, and after this you email your client with the combined data from those 5 entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the following steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>On top of your flow, add an Initialize Variable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Choose a name&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select Type Integer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave Initial value blank (or select a starting count)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In your Apply to each, add an Increment Variable (Increment means to add/change the count)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Increment the variable you’ve created on top with 1 in the value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Add the variable after your Apply to each step wherever you want, and it will give you the count.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Combine data from multiple apply to each into a single output file (Variables and compose)</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/combinemultipledata/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/combinemultipledata/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was a tricky one to figure out, took me a few hours and failed attempts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have log entries, and my flow is triggered to email them all that were submitted the day prior, at 8am.
Getting the data into the email pulls it into an apply to each (which makes sense, but is not what I want)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, there is a way around the apply to each, but I’ll not get into that here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to get conditional images in your Canvas app</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/conditional-images-canvasapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/conditional-images-canvasapp/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ever-had-a-scenario-where-someone-wanted-to-have-images-in-their-app-but-also-pull-them-from-a-source-somewhere">Ever had a scenario, where someone wanted to have images in their app, but also pull them from a source somewhere?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let’s say, you want to reflect their office image in your app. But you also want to possibility to overwrite/upload your own instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can do this by using an If statement and some variables, let’s look at the following scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You work for a company called Powerplatform with their email domain @Powerplatform.com&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get output from Adaptive Card choice sets</title><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/adaptivecards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:27:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/adaptivecards/</guid><description>&lt;p>Adaptive cards is the name for the pop-up you can get in Teams, with custom content asking you to confirm something, or to submit a remark.
One way of creating them is through Adaptive card Designer (JSON).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way is to use the new Cards (preview) method in PowerApps maker - find out how here: Microsoft Learn Page - &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to use your adaptive card as for example an approval, or you want the color choice you need to get the data that the card receives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/alias/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.nathalieleenders.com/posts/alias/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
