            </div>UsecaseYou want to show a report in Microsoft Teams, or when someone requests a sales overview of 2022, a card appears with that report in it. You can also of course set up Powerbi alerts as a trigger.
Right now, natively, dynamic reports do not work in cards. However, at MPPC they did announce this is possibly coming!
For now though, here is a way to make this possible.]]></description>

Cat Schneider helped me tremendously on this one, full credit to her! Find her blog here
Thank youFollowing these steps, results in some empty values also being added.
For example, if there is an empty entry, but the item exists and you specify that item it will show up.]]></description>

            </div>Ever noticed that when you select your columnname, in the dynamic data, it doesnt give you the result and it stays blank?Iâ€™d like to explain how you can get the value for your dropdown.
There is a difference between the display name, and the actual name of that value. Dataverse often uses @OData.Community.Display.V1.FormattedValue instead of the previous new_value_label.
In your Power automate flow, either run the flow and check the body, or add a Compose step after your Get Items/Update Item etc.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Are you looking for a boolean column in SQL? Or have a virtual table and need a toggle/checkbox in your app?If you have just a string/text field with True/False this wont work.
You need to convert the column in SQL to BIT.
Bit is an integer data type that can take a value of 0, 1, or NULL 1 for true, 0 for false.
Then reload/refresh your table into your dataverse/virtual table and it can be selected with a checkbox!]]></description>

            </div>Starting with an intro to variables, I want to explain how you can use a very simple counter to your Power Automate flow. Letâ€™s say you have an Apply to each, like 5 entries, and after this you email your client with the combined data from those 5 entries.
Add the following steps:
On top of your flow, add an Initialize Variable Choose a name Select Type Integer Leave Initial value blank (or select a starting count) In your Apply to each, add an Increment Variable (Increment means to add/change the count) Increment the variable youâ€™ve created on top with 1 in the value.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This was a tricky one to figure out, took me a few hours and failed attempts.
I have log entries, and my flow is triggered to email them all that were submitted the day prior, at 8am. Getting the data into the email pulls it into an apply to each (which makes sense, but is not what I want)
So, there is a way around the apply to each, but Iâ€™ll not get into that here.]]></description>

            </div>Adaptive cards is the name for the pop-up you can get in Teams, with custom content asking you to confirm something, or to submit a remark. One way of creating them is through Adaptive card Designer (JSON).
Another way is to use the new Cards (preview) method in PowerApps maker - find out how here: Microsoft Learn Page - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318
If you want to use your adaptive card as for example an approval, or you want the color choice you need to get the data that the card receives.]]></description>
