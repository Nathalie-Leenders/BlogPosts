For fundamentals, you can go to Microsoft Learn - Virtual training days and sign up for a virtual session, after which you will get a voucher to take that particular exam for free! Take note, the voucher will be valid for 90 days! So you have to take exam within that period. The other trick, is following Microsoft Ignite, Microsoft Build or other Cloud Tech Challenges. Next up, is the Microsoft Build Cloud Skill learning challenge. Only requirement is that you attend Microsoft Build (which is awesome, you should really attend this free event virtually!) and you can do the challenge. Build is upcoming on May 23-24 online. Once you’ve completed the challenge, you will get a free voucher to use for the exams mentioned in the FAQ’s.

He’s on Twitter here: @p3nf0ld His Blog I was trying to do dynamic data into a quickchart.IO code, which I learned how to do in Kristine’s video here Go check her out as well, she’s awesome! But, getting the chart in my canvas app, I couldn’t figure out how to add in values from variables or collections as the EncodeURL command uses plain text, and my values are not. I reached out on Twitter, tagged Kristine, and Pen responded, and very graciously decided to offer me his code. I’ve asked him if I could share, and he said yes, so here’s how to edit your Chart to add in variables, collections and more. Add in Basic chart (courtesy of Kristine’s video): Go to QuickChart.IO Choose the chart you want In your Canvas app, add in an image. In the Image property, type the following: \"https://quickchart.io/chart?c=\"\u0026 EncodeUrl(\" \") Between your \" \" you’ll want to paste the code from the chart URL (don’t copy /chart?c= as you already have that before your EncodeURL) Modify the data labels, datasets, backgrounds etc and that works (Takes some practice) (If you get a token error, check for any characters that may be in the wrong place, or missing brackets etc) Here’s where the “Quick Tip\" comes in and why I needed help. If you try and type in your collection, or variable in data it won’t recognize it. You need to wrap it as follows: Old: data:[1,2,3,4,5] New: data:[\"\u0026 First(Col1).Value \u0026 \",\r\"\u0026 First(Col2).Value \u0026 \",\r\"\u0026 First(Col3).Value \u0026 \",\r\"\u0026 First(Col4).Value \u0026 \",\r\"\u0026 First(Col5).Value \u0026 \"] So use \"\u0026 your variable/collection \u0026\" ","date":"2023-04-12","objectID":"/posts/quickchartiodynamic/:0:0","series":["how-to-doit"],"tags":["QuickChartIO","CanvasApps"],"title":"Quick tip!

Ever had the request to have certain words repeated, lets say in a header or footer? It can be anything, a date, name, product title, Business Unit etc etc. This can be achieved using XML Mapping in Microsoft Word. To get to the XML mapping, you must first have the Developer Tab activated. Go to File Options Customize this ribbon Enable the Developer (check the checkbox) Save Developer tab\rNow you’re able to open the Developer Tab, and in the middle you’ll find the XML Mapping. Here is where the fun starts. XML Mapping, as the name says, uses an XML file to map the words. Open NotePad, and copy/paste the following: \u003c?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8” standalone=”no”?\u003e \u003cDemoXMLNode xmlns=”http://CustomDemoXML.htm”\u003e \u003cName\u003e\u003c/Name\u003e \u003cInsertnewasyouwant\u003e\u003c/Insertnewasyouwant\u003e \u003c/DemoXMLNode\u003e (I got this code off of someones blog a while ago, if I remember who it was I will post it here, I promise) Use the \u003c\u003e and \u003c/\u003e to map your XML names. Save as .XML file. Now in Microsoft Word, on the XML Mapping pane, go to the dropdown, and click on (Add a new Part…) Select your file. It will show up as the following: Breaks start and End\rI’ve used Word1 and Word2, but you can of course specify your own naming in the XML. Next step is binding this to something on your form or document. Make sure you’re using a content control (under the developer tab, next to the XML Mapping, you’ll find the Rich Text, Plain Text, Dates, Checkboxes etc.) Insert a Text content control Place the text in this content control Select in your Word file what you want to have repeated (The content control) Right click on Word1 Select Map to selected Content control XML Mappings\rYou have now mapped that content control, to Word1 Now in your header, footer or where ever you want, Right click on Word1, Insert content control, and in this case Word1 as Plain text, and it will appear and be a repeated text from where you’re changing it. It might take a few seconds to reflect. Hope this helps.

Microsoft will change their documentation to reflect this… Bummer!\rOld content - Disclaimer - This does not work! Old blogpost for reference only, or, how to use business rules to fill a field valueI’m developing a solution with a SQL data backend. Using Virtual Tables I’ve mapped my SQL DB’s to Dataverse. I need quite a lot of dropdown/optionsets in my forms, but my SQL column is NVARCHAR (string/text) There is no choice column in SQL available. So how do I go around this? I’ve started thinking about the good old ‘Patch’ capability, to have a stand alone dropdown, patch the value to a field and that works. A colleague found an old optionset D365 blog post, and this is how we solved the issue: Create a choice in your solution. For this I’ll go with City1 Add the values you need to that choice (City1) In your form, add the column you need (City2) Add a new field, choice, choose from the existing Optionset you created in the first step Double click on this new field Go to Business Rules Add a new rule If City1 field value matches “New York” Update Field Value for City2 to “New York” Bsuiness rule - Set Field Value\rHide the City2 field as it’s not needed to show, City1 will have the dropdown, City2 will do the actual upload. Now when you select New York from the dropdown in City1, it automatically does the same for City2 which is where the historical data also resides.

I was on the First Time Contributor training yesterday, one of the Sharing is Caring sessions led by David Warner and Hugo Bernier. (\u003c3) M365 \u0026 Power Platform | Sharing Is Caring (pnp.github.io) In this training they explain how Github works, and how to edit an existing item using the Branches, Forks, Committing changes and how a Pull Request works. (I can highly recommend their sessions if you want to learn, there’s no recordings and it’s a safe space for all to ask questions and interrupt) Mind you, it was getting late for me, after a full workday (perks of being in The Netherlands and different timezones) so my mind kept reverting to Bork! instead of Fork. I couldn’t unhear it. So of course I shared this in the chat. Chat excerpt from the Sharing is Caring session\rDavid Warner started quoting Swedish Chef, and Hugo posted that he’d make a browser extension out of it. Of course I didn’t think he’d actually do it. After the training I did a post on Twitter how awesome this training was. Then this happened. 🧡After geeking out last night with @bernierh (🫶) he graciously shared how to change the Fork! button in Github to Bork!

You can do this by using an If statement and some variables, let’s look at the following scenario. You work for a company called Powerplatform with their email domain @Powerplatform.com You want to reflect the office uploaded image in your app when someone submits something. Add a button that searched for someone from your company, so you can switch between uploading your own image, or using their office picture. Add an editform to your app with an image control and textfield for email Add a button On your datasources, add Office365Users to your app On your Onselect from the button, add this statement: If(!IsBlank(Find(\"@Powerplatform.com\",DataCardValue1.Text)),\rSet(VarOfficeImage,true),Set(VarOfficeImage,false)); Make sure your datacardvalue matches the one in your email field. The variable will error but that’s fine as we’ll set that up now. What this does, is if you have for example Janedoe@Powerplatform.com it sets your variable, I will now explain how this variable works. On your image datacard, find the image1 field, and go to the Image Property. Paste the following code to your Image property: If(Form.Mode = FormMode.Edit,\rParent.Default,\rVarOfficeImage=true,Office365Users.UserPhotoV2(DataCardValue1),\rAddPicture1.Media) What this does, if that if you’re in edit mode modifying someone, it grabs the parent (existing) image, otherwise if the variable for your office image is true (if you pushed the button) to grab the user photo for the person you have specified in your email address field. If that variable is false (there is no match in the email field) you can add your own image through the regular image card.

One way of creating them is through Adaptive card Designer (JSON). Another way is to use the new Cards (preview) method in PowerApps maker - find out how here: Microsoft Learn Page - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview If you want to use your adaptive card as for example an approval, or you want the color choice you need to get the data that the card receives. On https://adaptivecards.io/designer/ design the card the way you want it. Make sure on the right-hand side, to add an ID element to your button or choice field. This ID Element is important so you can recognize your data later on in the PARSE JSON step. Once designed you can copy the code from the lower left corner Card Payload Editor into a text editor (to save for later/backup) or paste directly in your Flow. The new Cards Preview function offers the same functionality, however while I find the UI easier to use, the technical coding backend to it doesn’t give you an error when you don’t specify the ID. Your flow run will fail as it needs this parameter. To bypass, I copy/paste the code from the Card Preview option, into the Card Payload Editor from Adaptivecards.IO and check for an error there.

Choose your channel or chat option, and in the body copy/paste the code from the designer or adaptive card in your adaptive card message body. Use cases for adaptive cards: Approvals Needing information through text output Different choices of material, feedback or other choice options (Optional) I like to add a variable at the top level of my Power Automate Flow, something like VarColor so I can store the information from the output from the Parse JSON. You can of course just keep it as regular dynamic content. (If you’re using different nested steps a variable may be easier to work with) After your Teams card, add an action for Parse JSON (JSON sounds scary but I’ll walk you through it) On outputs, type the name of your card step, add _for spaces. Example: outputs(’Post_adaptive_card_and_wait_for_a_response’)?[’body’] On the schema area type {} Run your flow and check the run. Copy the full output of the Teams adaptive card Go back into edit, and in your Parse JSON step, click on Generate from Sample Paste the whole body there. Complete/save Now the output that’s in your newly generated schema will appear as Dynamic content. I like to Append to string Variable the Data for Color for example, but of course you can leave this step out. Hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions.
