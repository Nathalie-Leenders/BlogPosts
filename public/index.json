In my SQL DB I have an external primary key field. How do I get an automatic GUID? The PowerFX code GUID() is not supported on the form.

So this didnt work. Then I tried a Business Rule, setting the field value. However I found out formula is not available. I called in my awesome friend Cat Schneider, we took a look at it, and realised there was no way to do this without resorting to pro-code. So that left me with the last option (that I never thought I’d use) which is Javascript. I knew from my PL400 training, that it was technically possible to run a Javascript, on the Onload form, and make it do a thing. But how? We started looking at different scripts online, which opened a call, had many different elements in it, but the function wasnt being recognised. Without having extensive knowledge of Javascript we couldnt figure out at that time how to resolve it. I tried to contact someone else, but of course with it being Thanksgiving the following day I gave up for that particular time. The following day, a friend of mine came over, and I knew he was an experienced pro-coder, so I asked him; “How’s your Javascript?” We went through the script, and through a shorter version I had. We removed the call, simplified the code, and figured out where to put the function. Then we tested with just putting a simple word in our field to test if that worked. (Pro tip, use the logical name of your field, so for example cr3ae_fieldname) Once that worked, we came up with this script: ","date":"2023-11-27","objectID":"/posts/guidjavascriptinmodeldrivenapps/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["VirtualTable","Dataverse","Javascript"],"title":"How do I automatically have a GUID in my field?","uri":"/posts/guidjavascriptinmodeldrivenapps/#usecase"},{"categories":["Model Driven Apps"],"content":"\rThe solutionIn Notepad++ (or any other code editor you use) paste the following code: // The function name is guifunction, as specified in the first code line. function guifunction(executionContext) //We pass through a parameter, executionContext which later on in the second line will be called upon.

PowerBI Report in an Adaptive Card\rAfter I posted this blog, I got in touch with Luuk Postuma, who had been trying to get this to work, and he has shared his feedback so we can all learn from it: I attended Nathalie’s session at MPPC 2023 and cam home very excited to try this out. But, when it came to the details, I immediately ran into issues and bombarded Nathalie with a bunch of emails. The main issue I was having (among others) was that I only have a Power BI Premium-Per-User license and I just could not get it to work. I also have a Fabric 60-day trial, and figured that should be enough for me to use the “Export To File for Power BI Reports” I kept getting this error\rBased on some Google searches, it appeared that I would need a full Power BI Premium license, but after some more digging and trial and error, I learned that I was wrong! You can use “Export to File for Power BI Reports” with a Premium-Per-User license and a Fabric Trial license!! Here is the step I missed: You have to create a Power BI Workspace that uses the Fabric Trial capacity. To do this, go to your app.powerbi.com, select the settings gear at the top right and then select “Admin portal”, then select “Workspaces”. I kept getting this error\rFind your workspace in the list, click on the dots and select “Reassign workspace”:\rThen, select the Trial option: At this point, you should be good to test the solution until your Fabric Trial runs out. What I’ll do then depends on how much money my company wants to spend 😉 Now, for a few notes on using the “Export to File for Power BI Reports” action. Let me explain my simple test flow first. It goes like this: If a keyword (in this case ‘revenue’) is used in a specific Teams channel, I want it to export my Power BI revenue report to a .png file and then send it as an attachment in an email. At a high level, it looks like this: In the right branch, Teams simply responds to say “You will receive an email with the report in a minute” (because for me it typically takes 40 to 60 seconds). The left branch takes care of the .png export and emailing. The first part (Export to File….) looks like this: The Workspace value should be a workspace that you enabled as your Fabric (or Fabric Trial) workspace. The Report is the Report in that workspace. The Export Format can be PDF, PPTX or PNG. For an image, choose PNG. I also wanted to include a filter, and that took a bit of Googling too. But you can find a decent reference here (which relates to urls but work in this context too – instead of using URL?filter=Table/Field eq ‘value’ just use Table/Field eq ‘value’): Filter a report using query string parameters in the URL - Power BI | Microsoft Learn (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-url-filters) One note on this is that if you already have filters in your report, the filter you define in the Export to File settings will not work. Another thing I could not get to work was extracting just a visual from the report. Nathalie suggested just taking the visual, copying it to a new page, and then referencing that page instead. If you leave the filter off the new page and use a filter as I’ve shown in the Export to File settings, this will work best. Another thing to be aware of is that your table name (if used in the ReportLevelFilters Filter expression) should not contain spaces.

I reached out on Twitter, tagged Kristine, and Pen responded, and very graciously decided to offer me his code. I’ve asked him if I could share, and he said yes, so here’s how to edit your Chart to add in variables, collections and more. Add in Basic chart (courtesy of Kristine’s video): Go to QuickChart.IO Choose the chart you want In your Canvas app, add in an image. In the Image property, type the following: \"https://quickchart.io/chart?c=\"\u0026 EncodeUrl(\" \") Between your \" \" you’ll want to paste the code from the chart URL (don’t copy /chart?c= as you already have that before your EncodeURL) Modify the data labels, datasets, backgrounds etc and that works (Takes some practice) (If you get a token error, check for any characters that may be in the wrong place, or missing brackets etc) Here’s where the “Quick Tip\" comes in and why I needed help. If you try and type in your collection, or variable in data it won’t recognize it.

Ever had the request to have certain words repeated, lets say in a header or footer? It can be anything, a date, name, product title, Business Unit etc etc. This can be achieved using XML Mapping in Microsoft Word. To get to the XML mapping, you must first have the Developer Tab activated. Go to File Options Customize this ribbon Enable the Developer (check the checkbox) Save Developer tab\rNow you’re able to open the Developer Tab, and in the middle you’ll find the XML Mapping. Here is where the fun starts. XML Mapping, as the name says, uses an XML file to map the words. Open NotePad, and copy/paste the following: \u003c?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8” standalone=”no”?\u003e \u003cDemoXMLNode xmlns=”http://CustomDemoXML.htm”\u003e \u003cName\u003e\u003c/Name\u003e \u003cInsertnewasyouwant\u003e\u003c/Insertnewasyouwant\u003e \u003c/DemoXMLNode\u003e (I got this code off of someones blog a while ago, if I remember who it was I will post it here, I promise) Use the \u003c\u003e and \u003c/\u003e to map your XML names. Save as .XML file. Now in Microsoft Word, on the XML Mapping pane, go to the dropdown, and click on (Add a new Part…) Select your file. It will show up as the following: Breaks start and End\rI’ve used Word1 and Word2, but you can of course specify your own naming in the XML. Next step is binding this to something on your form or document. Make sure you’re using a content control (under the developer tab, next to the XML Mapping, you’ll find the Rich Text, Plain Text, Dates, Checkboxes etc.) Insert a Text content control Place the text in this content control Select in your Word file what you want to have repeated (The content control) Right click on Word1 Select Map to selected Content control XML Mappings\rYou have now mapped that content control, to Word1 Now in your header, footer or where ever you want, Right click on Word1, Insert content control, and in this case Word1 as Plain text, and it will appear and be a repeated text from where you’re changing it. It might take a few seconds to reflect. Hope this helps.

I was on the First Time Contributor training yesterday, one of the Sharing is Caring sessions led by David Warner and Hugo Bernier. (\u003c3) M365 \u0026 Power Platform | Sharing Is Caring (pnp.github.io) In this training they explain how Github works, and how to edit an existing item using the Branches, Forks, Committing changes and how a Pull Request works. (I can highly recommend their sessions if you want to learn, there’s no recordings and it’s a safe space for all to ask questions and interrupt) Mind you, it was getting late for me, after a full workday (perks of being in The Netherlands and different timezones) so my mind kept reverting to Bork! instead of Fork. I couldn’t unhear it. So of course I shared this in the chat. Chat excerpt from the Sharing is Caring session\rDavid Warner started quoting Swedish Chef, and Hugo posted that he’d make a browser extension out of it. Of course I didn’t think he’d actually do it. After the training I did a post on Twitter how awesome this training was. Then this happened. 🧡After geeking out last night with @bernierh (🫶) he graciously shared how to change the Fork! button in Github to Bork!

You can do this by using an If statement and some variables, let’s look at the following scenario. You work for a company called Powerplatform with their email domain @Powerplatform.com You want to reflect the office uploaded image in your app when someone submits something. Add a button that searched for someone from your company, so you can switch between uploading your own image, or using their office picture. Add an editform to your app with an image control and textfield for email Add a button On your datasources, add Office365Users to your app On your Onselect from the button, add this statement: If(!IsBlank(Find(\"@Powerplatform.com\",DataCardValue1.Text)),\rSet(VarOfficeImage,true),Set(VarOfficeImage,false)); Make sure your datacardvalue matches the one in your email field. The variable will error but that’s fine as we’ll set that up now. What this does, is if you have for example Janedoe@Powerplatform.com it sets your variable, I will now explain how this variable works. On your image datacard, find the image1 field, and go to the Image Property. Paste the following code to your Image property: PowerFx If(Form.Mode = FormMode.Edit, Parent.Default, VarOfficeImage=true,Office365Users.UserPhotoV2(DataCardValue1), AddPicture1.Media) What this does, if that if you’re in edit mode modifying someone, it grabs the parent (existing) image, otherwise if the variable for your office image is true (if you pushed the button) to grab the user photo for the person you have specified in your email address field. If that variable is false (there is no match in the email field) you can add your own image through the regular image card.

One way of creating them is through Adaptive card Designer (JSON). Another way is to use the new Cards (preview) method in PowerApps maker - find out how here: Microsoft Learn Page - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/cards/overview/?wt.mc_id=DX-MVP-5005318 If you want to use your adaptive card as for example an approval, or you want the color choice you need to get the data that the card receives. On https://adaptivecards.io/designer/ design the card the way you want it. Make sure on the right-hand side, to add an ID element to your button or choice field. This ID Element is important so you can recognize your data later on in the PARSE JSON step. Once designed you can copy the code from the lower left corner Card Payload Editor into a text editor (to save for later/backup) or paste directly in your Flow. The new Cards Preview function offers the same functionality, however while I find the UI easier to use, the technical coding backend to it doesn’t give you an error when you don’t specify the ID. Your flow run will fail as it needs this parameter. To bypass, I copy/paste the code from the Card Preview option, into the Card Payload Editor from Adaptivecards.IO and check for an error there.

Choose your channel or chat option, and in the body copy/paste the code from the designer or adaptive card in your adaptive card message body. Use cases for adaptive cards: Approvals Needing information through text output Different choices of material, feedback or other choice options (Optional) I like to add a variable at the top level of my Power Automate Flow, something like VarColor so I can store the information from the output from the Parse JSON. You can of course just keep it as regular dynamic content. (If you’re using different nested steps a variable may be easier to work with) After your Teams card, add an action for Parse JSON (JSON sounds scary but I’ll walk you through it) On outputs, type the name of your card step, add _for spaces. Example: outputs(’Post_adaptive_card_and_wait_for_a_response’)?[’body’] On the schema area type {} Run your flow and check the run. Copy the full output of the Teams adaptive card Go back into edit, and in your Parse JSON step, click on Generate from Sample Paste the whole body there. Complete/save Now the output that’s in your newly generated schema will appear as Dynamic content. I like to Append to string Variable the Data for Color for example, but of course you can leave this step out. Hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions.
