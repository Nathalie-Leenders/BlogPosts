    <description><![CDATA[(This is lengthy for a quick tip, whoops, scroll all the way down to quickly check the fix)
First of all, FULL credit goes to Pen Warner who graciously shared his QuickchartIO code with me that he used for his app. His app is awesome, check that out here.
He’s on Twitter here: @p3nf0ld His Blog
I was trying to do dynamic data into a quickchart.IO code, which I learned how to do in Kristine’s video here Go check her out as well, she’s awesome!]]></description>

            </div>Another Word tip, oh my…This explains how to set security on a Word document, restrict the editing, but allow forms to be filled out, and certain sections to be edited. For example, to add in attachments or images.
It’s the most frustrating process, but I hope I can explain it clearly.
If you find you cannot add a continuous break, but it does a page break, check out this article, or redo your document (that’s what I did)]]></description>

            </div>How to move stages automatically (BPF) using Power Automate (no http calls needed)Quick summary: You need to grab data from 3 different tables, link them using lookup columns, capture ID&rsquo;s, and add in conditions and use Data operations to shape the data into usable steps. Then add in a switch depending on your stage names, and add final actions updating your BPF table.
Sounds easy enough right?…..
Beaker&rsquo;s head on fireI hope this helps, and I tried explaining it clearly, please let me know in case of any questions, feedback, other methods etc.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I know I usually only do Power Platform, but Microsoft Word is bound to be in your project needs someday, or combining with Power Automate, so I figured why not?
Ever had the request to have certain words repeated, lets say in a header or footer? It can be anything, a date, name, product title, Business Unit etc etc.
This can be achieved using XML Mapping in Microsoft Word. To get to the XML mapping, you must first have the Developer Tab activated.]]></description>

Cat Schneider helped me tremendously on this one, full credit to her! Find her blog here
Thank youFollowing these steps, results in some empty values also being added.
For example, if there is an empty entry, but the item exists and you specify that item it will show up.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I had this issue today and figured I’d write a quick tip for it.
I’ve changed my app, modified flows, everything works fine in Dev, publish customizations, export as managed and move to Test. Verified the client can see the new app version, and asked her to test.
Uh-oh, the flows aren’t reflecting changes. XML MappingsIssue: Changes made in one environment, don’t reflect in another environment in a managed solutionSolution/Fix: Check on your Flows, or anything not reflecting the changes, for the Solution Layers Go to your flow for example, the ellipsis (…) and check the Solution Layers.]]></description>

            </div>Ever noticed that when you select your columnname, in the dynamic data, it doesnt give you the result and it stays blank?I’d like to explain how you can get the value for your dropdown.
There is a difference between the display name, and the actual name of that value. Dataverse often uses @OData.Community.Display.V1.FormattedValue instead of the previous new_value_label.
In your Power automate flow, either run the flow and check the body, or add a Compose step after your Get Items/Update Item etc.]]></description>

    <title>Quick tip! Boolean in SQL</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Are you looking for a boolean column in SQL? Or have a virtual table and need a toggle/checkbox in your app?If you have just a string/text field with True/False this wont work.
You need to convert the column in SQL to BIT.
Bit is an integer data type that can take a value of 0, 1, or NULL 1 for true, 0 for false.
Then reload/refresh your table into your dataverse/virtual table and it can be selected with a checkbox!]]></description>
