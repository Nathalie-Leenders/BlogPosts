# About me
I've started this site to share the knowledge I've gained as a Power Platform Developer. <br> Being a former hairdresser, turned IT, no coding background, no degree and self-taught on most things, I feel it's important to share the knowledge, so others can also learn from it.

I got awarded with the Microsoft MVP Award in June 2023, very excited to continue to share the knowledge!

**We're all in this journey together, my motto is, if you can do it, so can I..**
