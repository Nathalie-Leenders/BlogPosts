In 2024 due to personal reasons I havent done many events, but looking forward to doing more in 2025! I have a few event submissions pending, but if you're looking for someone to talk about topics such as Virtual Tables, Imposter Syndrome, Teams Adaptive Cards or many other topics (like Muppets) I'd be more than happy to get in touch with you! Love to travel as well for events. Feel free to check out my sessionize profile for my existing sessions, or get in touch for something tailor made.
