# Contributed to the Microsoft New Speaker Community Day 2023

When I saw the call for speakers open up for the Microsoft New Speaker Community Day, I was immediately drawn to the workshop. I myself only just started with my first demo in December 2022, and received so many great tips from others from the community that I wanted to share the knowledge. I've submitted 2 videos which you'll find below. The first is on how to handle Imposter Syndrome (we all have it), and the other is on how to start speaking/blogging.

I hope these tips help, I am always open to talking about these topics, feel free to reach out to me if you have questions.
