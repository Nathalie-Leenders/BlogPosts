## Usecase

You're trying to use Generative AI features in Copilot Studio, however it says it's not supported. How do you fix this?

## Enable the settings for your environment

You need to be a power platform admin for this.

Go to the Power Platform admin center

CLick on your environment.

On the lower right corner, enable these 2 settings:

Now you can use GenAI in your Copilot Studio bot!

It worked before (about a month ago at the time of this post) but it's not been adding to these options.
