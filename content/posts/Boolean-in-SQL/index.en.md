# Are you looking for a boolean column in SQL? Or have a virtual table and need a toggle/checkbox in your app?

If you have just a string/text field with True/False this wont work.

**You need to convert the column in SQL to BIT.**

Bit is an integer data type that can take a value of 0, 1, or NULL
1 for true, 0 for false.

Then reload/refresh your table into your dataverse/virtual table and it can be selected with a checkbox!
